# Process and Architecture

## Architecture Overview

- React frontend communicates with Express backend via RESTful API.
- Backend fetches and aggregates data from MongoDB.
- AI assistant uses OpenAI API to interpret user queries and return natural-language answers, tables or charts.


## Key Design Choices

- React 18 for modern component-based UI
- Tailwind for fast and consistent styling
- Express for lightweight backend routing
- MongoDB for flexibility in handling JSON log structure
- Used Chart.js (or Recharts) to present visual trends
